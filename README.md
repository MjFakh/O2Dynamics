# OxygenDynamics

The code calculates the range of steady-state solutions for the global oxygen mass balance taking a stochastic approach. 

The code contains a main loop to simulate the range of steady-state in a stochastic manner. The loop contains the range of values used to calculate the different oxygen sinks and sources. 

The code can be run without requiring high-performance computing. The results from the stochastic simulation would be plotted using a “fanchart” function. The function for “fanchart” is also included in the file named “fanChart.m”. The “fanchart” function needs to be saved in the same folder as the main code in order to plot the results.

The MATLAB code is written in MATLAB R2022b version.
